This collection features a series of C++ programs that explore the use of the Standard Template Library (STL) and demonstrate fundamental algorithmic techniques.

Example 12.1: Creates a vector containing the numbers 0 through 24, shuffles them randomly, and prints the result.

Example 12.2: Builds a list of integers from 0 to 24, then continuously removes and prints elements from the front until the list is empty.

Example 12.3: Similar to Example 12.1, but uses a deque instead of a vector. It shuffles the numbers and removes them one by one from the front while displaying each.

Example 12.4: Demonstrates a stack implemented with a list as its underlying container. It pushes numbers 1 to 9 onto the stack, then pops and prints them in last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.

Example 12.5: Uses the bitset class to invert a 16-bit binary number and displays the resulting bits one by one.

Example 12.6: Fills a vector of 100 elements and sets a specific value (37) at one index. It then searches for that value and prints its position if found.

Example 12.7: Performs a set union on two arrays of integers and prints the resulting sorted list of unique elements.

Exercise 12.8: Demonstrates how to fill arrays with specific values using the fill and fill_n functions, showing the results afterward.

Exercise 12.9: Uses the accumulate function to calculate and display both the sum and product of elements in an array.

Example 12.10: Defines a custom String class, shuffles and sorts a vector of string objects, and displays the contents before and after sorting.

Exercise 12.11: Reads a stream of input words, counts the frequency of each word using a map, and prints out each word alongside its count.
