Tasks 6.1 & 6.2
These tasks introduce a template-based linked list class called CustomList, which works with any data type. It provides essential functions such as:

push â€“ Add a new element at the front of the list

pop â€“ Remove and return the first element

insertAfter â€“ Insert a new value after a specific target value

deleteItem â€“ Remove a node that contains a specific value

This implementation helps you understand how linked lists work generically using templates and dynamic memory.

ðŸ”¹ Task 6.3
This version uses a fixed class called LinkedStructure that stores integer values only. It allows you to:

Create a list by entering numbers from the user

Display the current list

Remove the first or last element

Remove a specific value

This program is more interactive and helps reinforce how to manipulate nodes using pointers.
