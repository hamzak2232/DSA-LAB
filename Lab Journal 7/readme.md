ðŸ”¹ Example 7.1 â€“ Doubly Linked List with Integers
This program shows how to build a basic doubly linked list using int values. It includes:

Adding elements to the back (pushBack) and front (pushFront)

Removing elements from the back (popBack) and front (popFront)

Checking if the list is empty (isEmpty)

In this example, several numbers are added to the list, and then all elements are removed one by one from the back while being displayed.

ðŸ”¹ Exercise 7.1 â€“ Doubly Linked List with Large Numbers
This version of the doubly linked list uses long long data type to handle very large numbers. It supports:

Inserting values at the front and back

Removing elements from the front

Large numbers are inserted into the list, and then they are displayed by popping them from the front.
