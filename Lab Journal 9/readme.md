This folder contains two C++ implementations of binary trees demonstrating basic tree operations and traversals.

Exercise 8.1 - Binary Tree Using Array-Based Indexing Implements a binary tree using a fixed-size array (NUMNODES = 100).

Each node stores info and indices of left, right children, and parent.

Methods to insert left and right children by calculating array indices.

Supports tree traversals: inorder, preorder, and postorder.

Demonstrates tree traversal output with a sample tree of 7 nodes.

Exercise 8.2 - Binary Tree Using Dynamic Nodes (Pointers) Implements a binary tree using dynamically allocated nodes (with pointers).

Each node stores info and pointers to left, right children, and parent.

Supports adding root, left, and right children with pointer checks.

Includes functions for preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals.

Demonstrates tree traversals on a sample binary tree.

Both examples show fundamental binary tree structures and traversal methods â€” useful for understanding tree basics in different implementation styles.
